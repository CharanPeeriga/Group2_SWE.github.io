## Problem-Statement
Event Pulse is a high-level product designed to help users efficiently navigate and discover events. Our project is essentially an event navigator. At the highest level, it is an application that allows users to register accounts, provides transactional security, shows a wide database of the events available, and includes a support page (FAQ). This product is for anyone looking to efficiently arrive at an event of their choosing without too much hassle. It addresses the problem of inefficient event discovery and navigation by integrating GPS technology and the "Park Me" app. It offers a seamless experience for users to find events by providing concise search filters to take advantage of, providing an event algorithm for users based on their formerly attended events (or specifically stated preferences), and planning their routes with an integrated Navigation system. Unlike alternatives such as Eventbrite and Meetup, which provide event information and parking assistance separately, our project stands out by combining social media integration, common GPS applications like Apple Maps and Google Maps, and personalized event recommendations based on user preferences and transportation limits. This project is worth developing because it enhances the efficiency and safety of event navigation, offering features like push notifications and reminders for events, filtered searching and event list curation based on user needs, and a set range of input to display events within a userâ€™s preferred area. The target customers include students, young people, and individuals within specific transportation ranges. At the same time, the scope of the product extends to providing event recommendations and tailored suggestions based on user interests. From a technical perspective, the project is intriguing due to the challenges of integrating diverse APIs, learning new technologies like web development libraries(React), database functionalities with DBeaver, and developing a system with event holders, event seekers, and admin logins. The system is feasible, leveraging available resources and technology to create a user-friendly platform that simplifies event discovery and navigation. We will not be including a client and admin login. This product is interesting because it utilizes technology resources that most people are familiar with to combine the complex technologies of parking systems and event locators.
